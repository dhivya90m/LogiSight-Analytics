# LogiSight: 0→1 AI-Driven Logistics Monitoring Agent

### **Overview**
LogiSight is an automated logistics monitoring agent designed to bridge the gap between raw delivery data and executive-level decision-making. In complex marketplace ecosystems, identifying the "why" behind KPI fluctuations often requires hours of manual SQL deep-dives. LogiSight automates this root-cause analysis, transforming delivery data into actionable insights for Weekly Business Reviews (WBR).

---

### **🚀 The 0→1 Challenge**
* **The Problem:** Logistics teams often operate in a "reactive" state, discovering fulfillment friction only after KPIs dip. Manual reporting is slow and fails to catch micro-trends in real-time.
* **The Goal:** Build a "Self-Healing" system that moves from manual data extraction to automated insights, enabling scale without increasing analyst headcount.

---

### **🛠️ Technical Stack**
* **Language:** Python (Pandas, NumPy) for predictive modeling.
* **Data Layer:** Advanced SQL (Window Functions, CTEs for trend analysis and ETL).
* **Analysis:** Automated Root-Cause Analysis (RCA) logic for KPI governance.
* **Visualization:** Integration-ready data structures for Tableau, Power BI, and Looker.

---

### **💡 Key Features**
* **Automated KPI Governance:** Tracks critical delivery metrics to detect anomalies and fulfillment friction instantly.
* **SQL-Backed Root Cause Discovery:** Uses automated pipelines to drill down into specific dimensions where friction is highest.
* **WBR Automation:** Converts complex data trends into structured summaries, aiming to reduce manual reporting time by 40%.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle high-volume marketplace data, supporting multi-vertical scalability across grocery and retail.

---

### **📈 Operational Impact (Based on Proven Track Record)**
* **Reduced Manual Toil:** Leveraged automation to reduce manual handling by 30%.
* **Improved Accuracy:** Standardized KPI definitions to improve transaction accuracy by 80%.
* **Strategic Leverage:** Reduced reporting cycle times and improved operational cycle times by up to 3 days.
