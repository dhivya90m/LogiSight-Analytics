LogiSight: AI-Driven Logistics Agent

Objective: To automate the identification of delivery KPI fluctuations and provide SQL-backed root-cause insights for Weekly Business Reviews (WBR).


The Problem: Traditional logistics reporting required manual deep-dives into raw data to explain KPI dips, leading to delayed responses to fulfillment friction.





The Solution: Built a 0→1 agent that converts raw delivery data into actionable insights using SQL-backed monitoring tools.


Impact: Streamlined the reporting cycle and provided a scalable framework for real-time health monitoring of logistics operations.
